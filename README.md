### Description
The front of this project was just to have a nice interface to consume the API, but here I also added several modern technologies: I used cookies to store the logged-in user's credentials as well as tokens, I used React, NextJS and TypeScript because I was already familiar with the technologies and they are very performant to develop this type of app while maintaining developer experience, I used Redux to manage the global state of the platform, Axios and React-Query to manage the cache of requests and the requests themselves, React-Hook-Form and Zod to facilitate the validation and implementation of business rules in the forms and Tailwind with Shadcn-UI for a modern and simpler UI to implement, making the process of creating pages faster.
